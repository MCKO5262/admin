// This file is intentionally left empty as it's being deleted.
// The XML processor should handle file deletion if the content is empty.
// If not, this serves as a marker that the file is to be removed.
// In a real scenario, this <change> block for deletion would not provide <content>.
// However, to conform to the expected XML structure for this interaction,

// The ideal method for deletion is not specified in the prompt's XML format.
